Overview
This project is a Farm Management System written in C++. It helps farmers and agricultural businesses keep track of important information about the plants they grow, including:
* Best growing months
* Watering schedules
* Average plant size by season
* Preferred greenhouse temperature ranges
* Pricing information
The system uses fundamental C++ programming concepts and demonstrates how basic data structures can be applied to solve real-world problems in agriculture.

Features
* Add and store different types of plants (vegetables and fruits).
* Display all plant information in a structured format.
* Sort plants by price using a custom bubble sort algorithm.
* Search for plants by name.
* Manage memory dynamically using a manually implemented linked list.
* Handle user input with basic error checking to prevent program crashes.

Technologies Used
* C++ Language
* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Inheritance)
* Linked Lists (Custom-built, not using STL)
* Recursion (for memory cleanup)
* Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
1. Follow the prompts to display, sort, or search plants.
This project is designed to run from the terminal or command prompt.

Project Background
This project was inspired by a desire to combine technology with agriculture. The goal was to create a tool that would make it easier for farmers to organize their plant information efficiently and explore how basic software systems could improve small farm operations.

Future Improvements
* Add a full user menu system for easier navigation.
* Implement file saving and loading to store plant data permanently.
* Expand the system to track plant growth and seasonal yield.
* Introduce new plant categories such as trees, herbs, or flowers.
